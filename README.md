Comp Graphic and Visualization

-How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I prioritize thoroughly analyzing the projectâ€™s requirements to gain a clear, high-level understanding of what needs to be built. Afterward, I break down the project's components into categories for efficient task distribution. Once the planning is complete, I move on to development. This structured approach has served me well throughout my 3 year CS journey.

-How do I approach developing programs?
When developing software, I start by building a functional minimum viable product (MVP) to demonstrate the concept to my client and initiate a feedback loop. This ensures the program is tailored to their needs. The remainder of the development process involves iterating through these development and feedback cycles to refine the final product.

-How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science is helping me reach my goals by giving me the skills to solve complex problems, enhance my decision making, and give me the opportunity to have a meaningful career. Computational graphics and visualizations improved my technical skills through learning OpenGL and get creative with those skills which wil help immensely in the future.
